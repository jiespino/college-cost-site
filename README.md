This site is meant to give a simple view of U.S. college costs and state student aid.

On the "Search" tab, you can view important details for each U.S. college in every state such as average net yearly cost by household income, tuiton cost, admittance rates, etc. Some colleges give large amounts of aid for students from low-middle income families, so average net yearly cost can give some insight on how much aid a college will give.

Also, I attempted to find all major state programs that attempt to reduce tuition costs for students; These programs can be found by state on the "State Low Income Aid Programs" tab.
