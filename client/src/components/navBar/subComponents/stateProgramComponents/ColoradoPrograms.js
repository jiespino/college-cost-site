        <p>The "student's share of tuition" is a commonly used phrase in the programs below. Some of the programs below are said to cover the "student's share of tuition". Here is a definition:</p>
        <p>The student share of tuition = total tuition cost - the amount the student is expected to be able to contribute.</p>
        <p>For example if the tuiton cost for a university is $12,000/year and the expected amount a student should be able to contribute is $3,000/year,
        then the student share of tuition is $9,000/year and the program will award you this amount per year.</p>
