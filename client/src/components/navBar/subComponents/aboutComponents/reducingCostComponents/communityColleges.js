                <p>Community colleges lower student costs by offering cheaper tuition and by being located in towns/cities that have less expensive housing options. 
                  The coursework at these colleges is generally less rigorous,
                so students can work part-time jobs more easily in order to lower their financial burden. 
                For students skeptical if college/university is the right choice for their future,
                community college also provides a less expensive option of seeing if college is "for them", without having to pay thousands of dollars to test this at a
                public/private university.</p>
                <p>After attending a college for 1-2 years a student can transfer to a public/private university to pay fewer years of this more expensive tuition and get a bachelor's degree, or go into the workforce with an associates degree. This option does
                have the consequence of potentially having a less active social life, as 4 year universities do have more opportunities to socialize with students.
                Think sorority/university parties, extracurricular activities, sporting events, doing difficult assignments/group projects with your peers, etc.</p>
