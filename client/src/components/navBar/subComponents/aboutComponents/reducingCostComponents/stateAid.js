            <p>State aid for college students varies wildly.
              On the "State Low Income Aid Programs" tab at the top of this page, I attempted to find major programs in each state, such as free community college
              and reduced tuition programs for low-income students and list them there. I'm sure I missed some things, so please 
              do look for more opportunities in your state on your own if you don't find what you need there.
