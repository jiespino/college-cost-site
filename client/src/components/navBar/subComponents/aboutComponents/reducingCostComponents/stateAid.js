            <p>State aid for college students varies wildly depending on the part of the country you are in.
              On the "State Low Income Aid Programs" tab at the top of this page, I attempted to find major programs in each state, such as free community college
              and reduced tuition costs for low-income students and list them there. I'm sure I missed some things, so please 
              do look for more opportunities in your state on your own if you don't find what you need.
